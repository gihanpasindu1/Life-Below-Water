          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            Plastic pollution has become one of the most urgent threats to the
            health of our oceans and marine life. Every year, an estimated 8
            million tons of plastic enter the ocean, harming more than 700
            marine species through entanglement, ingestion, and habitat
            destruction. From tiny microplastics to large floating debris, these
            plastics travel vast distances, spreading toxic chemicals and
            disrupting entire ecosystems. Addressing plastic pollution is
            critical for maintaining biodiversity, protecting human health, and
            preserving the oceans for future generations. Urgent global
            cooperation, strong environmental policies, and community action are
            essential to tackle this challenge effectively.

          <h2 id="causes">Causes of Plastic Pollution</h2>
          <p>
            Plastic pollution is mainly caused by poor waste management
            practices and the widespread use of single-use plastics. Many
            communities lack proper recycling systems, leading to plastic being
            dumped in landfills or directly into waterways. In addition,
            littering and illegal dumping allow plastics to enter rivers and
            streams, which carry them out to the ocean. Once in the sea,
            plastics can travel across entire ocean basins, accumulating in huge
            gyres. Industrial activities, fishing gear losses, and packaging
            waste also add to the problem. These combined factors contribute to
            the continuous growth of plastic pollution threatening our marine
            environment.

          <h2 id="effects">Effects on Marine Life</h2>

          <p>
            Plastic pollution has devastating impacts on marine animals and
            entire ecosystems. Many marine creatures, such as turtles, dolphins,
            and seabirds, mistake plastic items for food, leading to fatal
            blockages and malnutrition. Entanglement in discarded fishing nets
            and other plastic debris can cause injury, drowning, or even death.
            Microplastics, which form as larger plastics break down, are
            ingested by fish and other small organisms, eventually making their
            way up the food chain and potentially harming human health. The
            presence of plastic disrupts delicate marine habitats, damages coral
            reefs, and alters the natural balance of ocean ecosystems,
            threatening biodiversity and sustainability.

        <h2 id="solutions">Solutions & Global Efforts</h2>
        <p>
          Worldwide initiatives are being developed to combat the escalating
          crisis of ocean plastic pollution. Many governments are implementing
          bans on single-use plastics, promoting the adoption of biodegradable
          materials, and encouraging innovative product designs that minimize
          waste. At the same time, new technologies are emerging to improve
          plastic recycling and transform waste into valuable resources.
          Community-based cleanup programs and coastal restoration projects are
          playing a crucial role in removing existing debris and restoring
          marine habitats. Educational campaigns are raising awareness about the
          impacts of plastic on marine ecosystems, inspiring individuals to
          adopt more sustainable lifestyles. By actively supporting these
          efforts, making environmentally conscious choices, and demanding
          stronger environmental policies, every person can contribute to
          protecting ocean biodiversity and ensuring a healthier, cleaner marine
          environment for future generations.
